## What is this?

This is a **Ruby on Rails** application, with basic unit tests, for which coverage is uploaded to Codecov on a daily basis via the Codecov Bash uploader. It can also serve as an example for how to integrate Codecov into your Ruby project. If the build is passing for this project, then Codecov's Ruby report processing is functional and correct on codecov.io.

## What's the difference between `Ruby-Standard-1` and `Ruby-Standard-2`?

[Ruby-Standard-1](https://github.com/codecov/Ruby-Standard-1) uses the Codecov gem to process coverage reports, while this repository, Ruby-Standard-2, uses Codecov's bash uploader to process reports. Otherwise, everything is the same between these two repos.

## Configuration

This project is written in `Ruby 2.6.3` using `Rails 5.2.3`. Unit tests are written in the [RSpec Rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) framework. Coverage reports are generated through the [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) gem and formatted via the [SimpleCov-Cobertura](https://github.com/dashingrocket/simplecov-cobertura) gem which converts the SimpleCov report into a `coverage.xml` file that is easily consumed by Codecov.

Unit tests: `spec/index_spec.rb` which tests `lib/index.rb`

Gemfile configuration:
```ruby
gem 'simplecov', require: false
gem 'simplecov-cobertura'
```
RSpec configuration (top of `spec/spec_helper.rb`):
```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start

require 'simplecov-cobertura'
SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::CoberturaFormatter
```
> `spec_helper.rb` is a file that contains settings specific to RSpec. If you're using another testing framework, you'll need to put this information in some other helper Ruby file. For example, if you're using Minitest, which is prepackaged with all Rails applications, you'll need to put the above lines of code inside `test/test_helper.rb`
